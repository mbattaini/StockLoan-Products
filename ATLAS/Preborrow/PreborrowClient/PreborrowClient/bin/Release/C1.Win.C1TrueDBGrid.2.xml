            <remarks>
            This method is used to check the integrity of the entries in the zip file. If the
            calculated checksum does not match the stored checksum, then either the zip file is
            corrupted or the program used to create the zip file is incompatible with 
            <b>C1Zip</b>.

            Encoding used for entry names and comments
            
            NOTE: this is culture-dependent, which is a really bad idea, but most zip packers
            use the default OEM code page to encode file names, so we have to go along with it...
            
            Note that Encoding.Default seems like a logical choice but doesn't really work for
            international locales. Instead, we need to create an encoding using the current
            OEMCodePage. That allows accents and international characters to be used in file
            names (like the zip built into Windows, allows names such as "Åland.txt", "Äiti.txt", 
            "Würth.txt", etc.).
            
            This has nothing to do with compression, it's just used to encode and decode entry

            <summary>
            A helper class for implementing an ambient property on a control.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Usage:
            An instance of AmbientPropertyMonitor must be created by the host control with the reference
            to that host as the parameter.
            The AmbientPropertyMonitor subscribes to the following events:
            <list type="bullet">
            <item>ParentChanged on the host and the whole parents' chain;
            </item>
            <item>(ambient property name)Changed or INotifyPropertyChanged on the host and all parents in the chain.
            NOTE: For the AmbientPropertyMonitor to work correctly, all controls that have the target property declared
            must also provide either a property changed event, or implement INotifyPropertyChanged and fire
            it at appropriate moments.
            </item>
            </list>
            <para>The AmbientPropertyMonitor monitors changes of the ambient property value on the host and all parents,
            and if a change occurs applies the value of the ambient property on the closest parent
            to that property on the host control, unless it has been changed independently of the AmbientPropertyMonitor
            (AmbientPropertyMonitor assumes that when it is created, the ambient property on the host has default,
            unchanged value).
            </para>
            <para>It is recommended that all controls declaring the target property also provide
            the Reset(property) and ShouldSerialize(property) methods, calling the
            <see cref="M:C1.Util.Win.AmbientPropertyMonitor.ResetValue"/> and <see cref="P:C1.Util.Win.AmbientPropertyMonitor.IsValueAmbient"/> methods as needed.

            <summary>
            Initializes a new instance of the AmbientPropertyMonitor class.
            </summary>
            <param name="host">Control on which the ambient property will be monitored.</param>
            <param name="propertyName">The name of the monitored property.
            The type of the property MUST be an enumeration.</param>
            <remarks>
            An instance of this class must be created in the constructor 
            of the host control.
            It is assumed that the value of the ambient property that will be monitored
            by the AmbientPropertyMonitor has not been set yet (i.e. has the default value)
            at the time the AmbientPropertyMonitor is constructed.

        <member name="M:C1.Util.Win.AmbientPropertyMonitor.ResetValue">
            <summary>
            Notifies the AmbientPropertyMonitor that the value of the monitored property
            has been reset. If the host control is currently parented to a container
            which itself defines the monitored property, the value from that parent
            is assigned to the property on the host.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            It is recommended that the host defines a Reset method for the target
            property, and calls this method from that. E.g.:
            <code>
            private AmbientPropertyMonitor __ambientVisualStyleMonitor = null;
            ...
            ctor() {
                __ambientVisualStyleMonitor = new AmbientPropertyMonitor(this, "VisualStyle");
                ...
            }
            public VisualStyle VisualStyle {
                get { ... }
                set { ... }
            }
            protected void ResetVisualStyle() {
                ...
                __ambientVisualStyleMonitor.ResetValue();
            }
            </code>
            </remarks>
        </member>
        <member name="P:C1.Util.Win.AmbientPropertyMonitor.IsValueAmbient">
            <summary>
            Gets the value indicating whether the monitored property
            currently has the ambient value, i.e. the value has been set
            (by the AmbientPropertyMonitor) based on the value of a parent of the host.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            It is recommended that the host defines a ShouldSerialize method for the target
            property, tests IsValueAmbient in that method, and returns false if IsValueAmbient
            returns true. E.g.:
            <code>
            private AmbientPropertyMonitor __ambientVisualStyleMonitor = null;
            ...
            ctor() {
                __ambientVisualStyleMonitor = new AmbientPropertyMonitor(this, "VisualStyle");
                ...
            }
            public VisualStyle VisualStyle {
                get { ... }
                set { ... }
            }
            protected bool ShouldSerializeVisualStyle() {
                if (__ambientVisualStyleMonitor.IsValueAmbient)
                    return false;
                ...

            CAUTION: Use this attribute with extreme care. Incorrect use can create security weaknesses.
            This attribute can be applied to methods that want to call into native code without incurring 
            the performance loss of a run-time security check in doing so. The assertion and subsequent 
            demands performed when calling unmanaged code is omitted at run time, resulting in substantial 
            performance savings. Only code that has been granted the UnmanagedCode permission can do this 
            (see SecurityPermissionFlag). Using this attribute in a class or module applies to 
            all contained methods.

            <summary>
            This interface is used to allow objects and collection to serialize
            types of their members in a custom way.
            If a collection implements this interface, TypeToString is invoked during
            serialization of collection items, and for all items for which it returns a
            non-null string, that string is used as the element name of the item.
            If a class implements this interface, AND a member of that class has
            attribute TypeNameSerialization.Custom, AND does not have attribute
            XmlAttribute (i.e. is serialized as an element), TypeToString is invoked
            on the owner when that member is serialized, and if that returns a non-null
            string, that string is used as the value of TypeName attribute.
            When deserializing a collection which implements this interface,
            StringToType is invoked for each new item in the collection, and if that
            returns a non-null type, that type is used to create the item. Otherwise,
            TypeNameSerialization attribute is used.
            When deserializing a class which implements this interface, StringToType
            is invoked on that class for members with TypeNameSerialization.Custom
            attribute set.

            </summary>
            <remarks>The BeforeColUpdate event occurs after editing is completed in a cell, but before data is moved from the cell to the grid's internal copy buffer. 
            The data specified by the OldValue argument moves from the cell to the grid's copy buffer when the user completes editing within a cell, as when tabbing to another column in the same row, pressing the Enter key, or clicking on another cell. Before the data has been moved from the cell into the grid's copy buffer, the BeforeColUpdate event is triggered. This event gives the application an opportunity to check the individual grid cells before they are committed to the grid's copy buffer. 
            If your event procedure sets the Cancel argument to True, the previous value is restored in the cell, the grid retains focus, and the AfterColUpdate event is not triggered. Change the current cell text by setting OldValue to the value wanted to display (other than the previous value).
            To restore OldValue in the cell and permit the user to move focus off of the cell, set Cancel to False and set the cell to OldValue as follows: </remarks>

            on each side.
            Border is designed to be extended so you can easily implement
            3-D effects, compound borders, etc.
